				<h2>Fly To The Limit</h2>
				<p>Fly to the Limit is the first website I had designed and coded from start to finish.</p>
				<p>I learnt a lot about how css can be applied to create shapes and layouts. I also learnt how to use 3rd party javascript/Jquery plug-ins (Magnific Popup) and we wrote a javascript validation kit which we used to validate forms submited by users.</p>

				<h2>Ghibli Characters</h2>
				<p>This site was built to display different characters from Studio Ghibli films along with some made up data. Using JSON I was able to store relevant data and pull it back when each characters name was clicked.</p>
				<p>This was a short project but I really enjoyed working with JSON. I took style cues from the official Studio Ghibli website while designing.</p>

			<div id="forum">
				<h2>Fallout Forum</h2>
				<p>This forum was built using php with javascript handling some client side validation and then the php server running its own validation before data was inserted into the database.</p>
				<p>Even though the design is very simple it took a while to wrap my head around the sidebar navigation and im really happy with the amount of work I put into everything behind the scenes.</p>
				<p>Its a very standard forum with users being able to create posts and threads with the ability to edit their own content, while admins can do the same but edit and delete anyones content.</p>

				<h2>Pokedex</h2>
				<p>Here it is, my final idustry project. The Pokedex was something I wanted to make from nearly the begining of my studies. It utilizes some crazy css properties and is built on Laravel.</p>
				<p>I learnt so much about laravel and even more about user experience. I had many classmates test this site most days and as such my final product strayed from my inital designs a lot, but im happy they did.</p>
				<p>Getting all 720 pokemon images was a fun challenge, I ended up writing a small piece of javascript that would generate a page loaded with images of all the pokemon, which made it easy to save them all into one folder in one go.</p>
